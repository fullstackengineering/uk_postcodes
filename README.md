# uk_postcodes

All the files can be downloaded from doogal:
https://www.doogal.co.uk/PostcodeDownloads

The postcode outward trimmed file doesn't need to be generated, you can just download the 'Postcode districts (e.g. BB3, BB4 etc)' link on that page under the 'Overview CSVs' heading:
https://www.doogal.co.uk/PostcodeDistrictsCSV/
Then just copy and paste it into the postcode_outward_trimmed.csv file and remove the header.
